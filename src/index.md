## welcome
Hi, my name's Krish! I'm a high schooler who's really into computersâ€”especially open-source software, systems programming, bioinformatics, cyber security, and *nix operating systems (mainly Linux and BSD).

My tech journey started all the way back when I was seven years old, where in the summer of 2012, my dad bought me the popular video game Minecraft; little did he know, this game would consume most of my life for the next five years. The game was cool and all, but eventually I wanted more, and I started to create "mods" (modifications) for the game. This led me to learn my first programming language: Java.
## software development
/dev/zero's name signifies my programming philosophy: keep code minimal and straightforward.

Simple code has many benefits:

* less bugs
* low memory footprint
* longer software lifetime

Needlessly complex code opens the door to errors and vulnerabilities. Keep it simple, stupid.
