<p>Hi, my name&#39;s Krish! I&#39;m a high schooler who&#39;s really into computersâ€”especially open-source software, systems programming, bioinformatics, cyber security, and *nix operating systems (mainly Linux and BSD).</p>

<p>My tech journey started all the way back when I was seven years old, where in the summer of 2012, my dad bought me the popular video game Minecraft; little did he know, this game would consume most of my life for the next five years. The game was cool and all, but eventually I wanted more, and I started to create &#8220;mods&#8221; (modifications) for the game. This led me to learn my first programming language: Java.</p>

<h2 id="software%20development">software development</h2>

<p>&#47;dev&#47;zero&#39;s name signifies my programming philosophy: keep code minimal and straightforward.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Good design is as little design as possible. - Dieter Rams</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simple code has many benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>less bugs</li>
<li>low memory footprint</li>
<li>longer software lifetime</li>
</ul>

<p>Needlessly complex code opens the door to errors and vulnerabilities. Keep it simple, stupid.</p>
